## Rails Gallery Test

This was my first attempt at creating a rails backend for a React powered photo gallery. I used a lot of the same code from my [blog](https://github.com/velossien/rails-guide-blog) I created using this [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I quickly realized I did not need everything included in a full Rails app, so I switched over to an API-only Rails app ([repo](https://github.com/velossien/railsgalleryapitest)).  I decided to keep this repo up since it shows some of the progress I made transfering from a blog app to a photo gallery.
